            Hi  i'm Abdifatah.
            I am a passionate and dedicated Software Engineering student at Kenyatta University and Moringa School, currently sharpening my skills through hands-on, real-world projects. This project showcases my growing expertise in designing, developing, and deploying scalable software solutions. I’ve applied key concepts such as clean code, version control, and user-centered design while working with modern technologies and tools. As I continue my journey in tech, I aim to build impactful solutions that solve real problems. This project reflects both my learning progress and commitment to continuous growth in the software development field.

       <p>
        My journey into tech began with a deep curiosity about how digital tools work and a strong desire to build things that solve real problems. As a student at Kenyatta University and Moringa School, I’ve been able to turn that curiosity into hands-on skills in software engineering. From writing my first lines of code to developing full applications, every step has strengthened my passion for technology. 
        This project represents not just technical growth, but the dedication and resilience I’ve built along the way. I’m committed to continuous learning and using tech to make a positive impact.
